Project 11 - People and Parcel Share a Ride Large Size

Problem Description:
--------------------
We have K taxis located at the depot (point 0). These taxis are assigned to serve
two types of transportation requests:

1. Passenger requests (N requests, indexed 1..N):
   - Each passenger i has a pickup point i.
   - Each passenger i has a drop-off point i + N + M.
   - Constraint: A passenger must be transported directly from pickup to drop-off
     without intermediate stops in between.

2. Parcel requests (M requests, indexed 1..M):
   - Each parcel i has a pickup point i + N.
   - Each parcel i has a drop-off point i + 2N + M.
   - Each parcel i has a quantity q[i].
   - Each taxi k has a maximum parcel capacity Q[k].

Travel distances:
- d(i,j) is the distance from point i to point j,
  where i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., 2N + 2M}.
- Point 0 is the depot.

Objective:
----------
Construct feasible routes for the K taxis such that:
- Every passenger and parcel request is served exactly once.
- For passengers: pickup → drop-off is a direct trip (no interruptions).
- For parcels: taxi capacities Q[k] must not be exceeded.
- Each route starts and ends at the depot (0).
- The maximum route length among all K taxis is minimized
  (load balancing between taxis).

Route representation:
---------------------
A route of taxi k is represented as a sequence:
    r[0], r[1], ..., r[Lk]
where:
- r[0] = r[Lk] = 0 (starts and ends at depot)
- Lk is the length of the route (number of visited points)

Input format:
-------------
Line 1: N M K
Line 2: q[1] q[2] ... q[M]                (parcel quantities)
Line 3: Q[1] Q[2] ... Q[K]                (taxi capacities)
Next (2N + 2M + 1) lines: distance matrix d(i,j)

Output format:
--------------
Line 1: integer K (number of taxis)
For each taxi k = 1..K:
    Line 2k  : integer Lk (length of route)
    Line 2k+1: sequence r[0] ... r[Lk]
