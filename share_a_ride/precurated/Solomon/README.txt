This dataset is for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and is taken from the following paper:
- Marius M Solomon. Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints.
  Operations Research, 35(2):254-265, 1987.
- The dataset contains 56 instances with 100 customers and one depot.
- The instances are divided into 6 groups (C1, C2, R1, R2, RC1, RC2)
- Each group has different characteristics in terms of customer distribution and time window constraints.
- The instances are widely used for benchmarking and testing new algorithms.

Here we use this dataset for benchmarking SOTA algorithms.
