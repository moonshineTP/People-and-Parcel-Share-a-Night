This dataset is for benchmarking, taken from the following paper:
- Golden, B. L., Wasil, E. A., Kelly, J. P., & Chao, I.-M. (1998). The impact of
metaheuristics on solving the vehicle routing problem: algorithms, problem sets, and computational results. In Fleet management and logistics
(pp. 33–56). Springer.

In this project we use this for benchmarking.
We have deleted the DISTANCE specs in the original file for the scope of this project.
