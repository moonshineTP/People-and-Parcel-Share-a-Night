This dataset is for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and is taken from the following paper:
- Rochat, Yves, and Éric D. Taillard.
- “Probabilistic diversification and intensification in local search for vehicle routing.”
- Journal of Heuristics, Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 147-167, 1995.

We use this dataset for testing of the resulting SOTA algorithms.
