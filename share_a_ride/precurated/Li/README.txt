The dataset is taken from the following paper:
- Li, F., Golden, B., & Wasil, E. (2005). Very large-scale vehicle routing: new
test problems, algorithms, and results. Computers & Operations Research,
32 , 1165-1179

In this project we use this for benchmarking SOTA algorithms.
We have deleted the DISTANCE specs in the original file for the scope of this project.
